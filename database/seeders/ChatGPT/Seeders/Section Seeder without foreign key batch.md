Got it! Since the `sections` table you provided does not have a `batch_id` anymore, it’s simpler. I'll just create a seeder for sections with the names "A", "B", and "NA", and you can optionally customize the number of seats per section.

Here’s how you can proceed:

### Steps:
1. **Generate Seeder**: If you haven't already created the seeder, use the following command:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:seeder SectionsTableSeeder
   ```

2. **Edit Seeder Class**: Now, you can edit the `SectionsTableSeeder` to insert the section names ("A", "B", "NA") along with their seats and status.

### Seeder Code:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

class SectionsTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Inserting section data
        DB::table('sections')->insert([
            [
                'name' => 'A',
                'seat' => 30, // Customize number of seats as needed
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'B',
                'seat' => 30, // Customize number of seats as needed
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'NA',
                'seat' => 0, // Section 'NA' might not have any seats
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Inserting Data**: In this case, we directly insert three sections ("A", "B", and "NA").
  - **`name`**: The section name (either "A", "B", or "NA").
  - **`seat`**: The number of seats for each section (set to 30 for "A" and "B", and 0 for "NA" – you can adjust these as per your requirements).
  - **`status`**: A boolean flag set to `1` for active sections.
  - **Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` are set to the current time using `now()`.

### Running the Seeder:
Once the seeder is created and edited, run the following command to execute the seeder and insert the data into your `sections` table:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=SectionsTableSeeder
```

Or, if you want to run all seeders:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Conclusion:
This will seed your `sections` table with sections "A", "B", and "NA" with the specified number of seats and an active status. Feel free to adjust the seat numbers or any other values as needed.
