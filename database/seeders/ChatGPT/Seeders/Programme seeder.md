Certainly! To create a **seeder** in Laravel 11 for your `programs` table with predefined program names such as "Composite Course," "Mains Guidance Programme," "Prelims Crash Course," and "Test Series," you can follow these steps:

### Steps:

1. **Create Seeder Class**: If you don't have a seeder for the `programs` table, you can generate one using the Artisan command:
   ```bash
   php artisan make:seeder ProgramsTableSeeder
   ```

2. **Edit Seeder Class**: Once the seeder is generated, you'll need to edit it to insert the programs into the database.

Here is the code for the seeder to insert your sample programs into the `programs` table:

### Seeder Code:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

class ProgramsTableSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Inserting the programs data
        DB::table('programs')->insert([
            [
                'name' => 'Composite Course',
                'description' => 'A comprehensive program combining all aspects of preparation.',
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'Mains Guidance Programme',
                'description' => 'Focused program for mains exam preparation.',
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'Prelims Crash Course',
                'description' => 'A short and intensive course for prelims exam preparation.',
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'Test Series',
                'description' => 'A series of mock tests to help students evaluate their readiness.',
                'status' => 1,
                'created_at' => now(),
                'updated_at' => now(),
            ]
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`DB::table('programs')->insert([...])`**: This inserts multiple records into the `programs` table.
- **`name`**: The name of the program (e.g., "Composite Course").
- **`description`**: A brief description of the program (you can modify this as needed).
- **`status`**: The default value is set to `1`, indicating that the program is active.
- **`created_at` and `updated_at`**: These timestamps are generated using `now()`.
- **`softDeletes()`**: Laravel automatically handles `deleted_at` column when you call the `delete()` method on a record.

### Running the Seeder:
After creating and editing the seeder, run the following command to execute the seeder and insert the data into your database:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ProgramsTableSeeder
```

Alternatively, if you want to run all seeders (including this one), you can simply execute:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Conclusion:
This will seed your `programs` table with the specified program names and descriptions. You can add more programs or customize the descriptions based on your needs. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
