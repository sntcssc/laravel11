Deployment:

In Laravel 11 (or any version of Laravel), when you're deploying to shared hosting, you may encounter the issue where you need to access your site with `/public` in the URL, like `yourdomain.com/public`.

To remove `/public` from the URL, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Move the Contents of the `public` Directory
Move the contents of the `public` directory to the root of your shared hosting directory (where your `index.php` file and other files are).

Here’s how:

- **Copy the following files/folders from the `public` directory:**
  - `index.php`
  - `.htaccess`
  - `favicon.ico` (if you have one)
  - `robots.txt` (if you have one)
  
- **Move them to the root directory of your hosting.** This is typically where `public_html`, `www`, or the document root of your website is.

### 2. Update the `index.php` Files
Now that you've moved the `index.php` file, you'll need to update it to reflect the new locations of your Laravel files.

- Open the `index.php` file (the one you moved to the root) and find these lines:

```php
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
```

- Change them to:

```php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php';
```

This is because you moved the files up one directory, and these paths need to reflect that change.

### 3. Update the `.htaccess` File
- In the root directory, create or modify the `.htaccess` file to rewrite URLs properly without the `/public` part.

Here’s a typical `.htaccess` file you can use:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    # Redirect all requests to the index.php file in the public folder
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
```

### 4. Configure the `APP_URL` in `.env`
Ensure that the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file is set correctly to match the root of your domain (without `/public`):

```ini
APP_URL=http://yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Test Your Site
After making these changes, test your website by visiting `yourdomain.com`. It should load without the `/public` in the URL.

### Troubleshooting
- If you still can't access the site, check if your hosting environment requires special configurations for `.htaccess` or if you need to configure any custom settings (e.g., in `cPanel` or `.user.ini`).

This process should work for most shared hosting environments. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

and Final file should be:

It looks like you're trying to rewrite URLs to route through the `public` folder, but the rule at the bottom of your `.htaccess` file is incorrect. Specifically, this line:

```apache
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
```

This will redirect all requests to the `/public` subdirectory, which is the opposite of what you want.

### Solution:
You need to **remove** this last rewrite rule because the main goal is to access Laravel's `index.php` in the root, not inside `/public`.

Your `.htaccess` file should look like this:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
        Options -MultiViews -Indexes
    </IfModule>

    RewriteEngine On

    # Handle Authorization Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

    # Handle X-XSRF-Token Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:x-xsrf-token} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_X_XSRF_TOKEN:%{HTTP:X-XSRF-Token}]

    # Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
    RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]

    # Send Requests To Front Controller...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Explanation:
- **Remove the `RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]`** that redirects to the `/public` folder. 
- The rest of the rules already send requests to the `index.php` file in the root directory, which should now work properly.
  
After doing this, you should be able to access your Laravel app without `/public` in the URL.

### Final Check:
Make sure:
1. The `index.php` and `.htaccess` files are moved to the root directory.
2. Your `.env` file has the correct `APP_URL`, pointing to `http://yourdomain.com` (without `/public`).
3. Your Laravel application is set up to run from the root directory.

Let me know if this resolves the issue!

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
