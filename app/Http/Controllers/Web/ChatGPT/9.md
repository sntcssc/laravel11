Certainly! Here’s the **complete route setup** for your Laravel application, considering all the steps in the form process (with `GET` and `POST` routes), including the final submission and preview functionality.

You can place this code in the `routes/web.php` file:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\StudentFormController;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// Route group for authenticated users
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {

    // Step 1: Show the form for Student Personal Details
    Route::get('student/form/1', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep1'])
        ->name('student.form.step1');
    Route::post('student/form/1', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep1'])
        ->name('student.submit.step1');

    // Step 2: Show the form for Student Details
    Route::get('student/form/2', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep2'])
        ->name('student.form.step2');
    Route::post('student/form/2', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep2'])
        ->name('student.submit.step2');

    // Step 3: Show the form for Preparation Details
    Route::get('student/form/3', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep3'])
        ->name('student.form.step3');
    Route::post('student/form/3', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep3'])
        ->name('student.submit.step3');

    // Step 4: Show the form for Sources Used
    Route::get('student/form/4', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep4'])
        ->name('student.form.step4');
    Route::post('student/form/4', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep4'])
        ->name('student.submit.step4');

    // Step 5: Show the form for CSAT Preparation Details
    Route::get('student/form/5', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep5'])
        ->name('student.form.step5');
    Route::post('student/form/5', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep5'])
        ->name('student.submit.step5');

    // Step 6: Show the form for Additional Preparation Details
    Route::get('student/form/6', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep6'])
        ->name('student.form.step6');
    Route::post('student/form/6', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep6'])
        ->name('student.submit.step6');

    // Step 7: Show the form for Personality Detail
    Route::get('student/form/7', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep7'])
        ->name('student.form.step7');
    Route::post('student/form/7', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep7'])
        ->name('student.submit.step7');

    // Step 8: Show the form for SFG Program Knowledge
    Route::get('student/form/8', [StudentFormController::class, 'showStep8'])
        ->name('student.form.step8');
    Route::post('student/form/8', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitStep8'])
        ->name('student.submit.step8');

    // Preview page - Shows all entered data for review before final submission
    Route::get('student/preview', [StudentFormController::class, 'preview'])
        ->name('student.preview');

    // Final submit action - Submit the entire form after review
    Route::post('student/submit', [StudentFormController::class, 'submitFinal'])
        ->name('student.submit.final');

});
```

### **Explanation of Routes:**

1. **Step 1 to Step 8 (GET and POST)**  
   For each step (1 through 8), you have two routes:
   - `GET`: Renders the form for the specific step (displaying the form where the student can enter data).
   - `POST`: Submits the data for the specific step. This route will save the data for that step and redirect the user to the next step.

   These routes follow the pattern:
   - `GET student/form/{step}` will show the form for the step.
   - `POST student/form/{step}` will handle form submission for that step.

   Each route is mapped to a controller method such as `showStep1`, `submitStep1`, etc. You’ll need to implement these methods in the `StudentFormController`.

2. **Preview Page** (`GET student/preview`):  
   This route is responsible for displaying the review/preview page with all the entered information. This will allow the student to verify all the data before the final submission.

3. **Final Submit** (`POST student/submit`):  
   This route is for the final submission of the entire form. After the student has reviewed all details and clicked on the final "Submit" button, the form data will be processed, and the submission will be marked as complete.

### **Route Flow Summary:**

1. The student starts by filling in **Step 1** by going to `/student/form/1` (GET) and submitting the form at `/student/form/1` (POST).
2. This process continues step by step until the student completes **Step 8**.
3. After completing all steps, the student is redirected to the **Preview** page at `/student/preview`, where they can review the data.
4. If the student agrees with the information and submits, they will click the **Submit** button on the preview page, which triggers the final submission via `/student/submit` (POST).

### **In the `StudentFormController`**, you will implement the following methods to handle each route:

1. `showStep1`, `submitStep1`, ..., `showStep8`, `submitStep8`: These methods will handle the display of the form and submission for each step.
2. `preview`: This method will load the data entered across all steps and pass it to the view for review.
3. `submitFinal`: This method will process the final form submission and store the form as complete.

### **Sample `StudentFormController` Method for Step 1 (as an example):**

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Student;
use App\Models\StudentDetail;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class StudentFormController extends Controller
{
    // Show Step 1 - Student Personal Details
    public function showStep1()
    {
        return view('student.form.step1');
    }

    // Handle Step 1 Submission
    public function submitStep1(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'first_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'last_name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            // Add other validations as needed
        ]);

        $student = auth()->user()->student; // Get the authenticated student's model
        $student->update($request->only(['first_name', 'last_name']));  // Save personal details
        
        // Redirect to the next step (Step 2)
        return redirect()->route('student.form.step2');
    }

    // Add similar methods for each step (2 through 8)

    // Preview - Show all details entered by the student
    public function preview()
    {
        $student = auth()->user()->student; // Get authenticated student

        return view('student.preview', compact('student'));
    }

    // Final submission of the form
    public function submitFinal(Request $request)
    {
        // Handle final submission logic (e.g., mark as complete, send notifications, etc.)
        $student = auth()->user()->student;
        $student->update(['status' => 'submitted']); // Set status as submitted
        
        // Redirect to a confirmation page or show success message
        return redirect()->route('student.form.step1')->with('status', 'Your form has been successfully submitted!');
    }
}
```

### **Conclusion:**
- These routes will guide your application flow step by step.
- You'll need to implement the form views (`step1.blade.php`, `step2.blade.php`, ..., `preview.blade.php`) to make the form interactive and user-friendly.
- Each form will contain a submission button that calls the POST route for that step.
- At the end of the process, students will be able to review and submit their forms.
